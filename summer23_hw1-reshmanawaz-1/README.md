Please clone this repository, edit README.md to answer the questions, and fill up functions to finish the homework.

- Please find each question in a separate folder under [files](/files).
- For non-coding questions, fill out the answers in the README file.
- For coding questions, edit the files and check them in.
- For coding questions unless specified, you should add unit tests to the student_test.cc.
  We will clone and test your repo using your tests and some other tests (that are not provided). Your code should pass all of them.
- For submission, please push your answers to Github before the deadline.
- Deadline: June 13th by 12:00 pm (noon)


## Question 1: 

 1. Implement the following functions in q.cc.
 2. Write some unit tests for them in student_test.cc

Reverse:
Given a vector, return its reversed rersion.

Plus One:
Given a positive integer represented by an array􏰒of digits, add one to that number. If the input as invalid, (i.e. digits are not between 0 to 9), return -1

## Question 2: 

 1. Implement the following functions in q.cc.
 2. Write some unit tests for them in student_test.cc

Write a function that returns true if the input number was prime and false otherwise.

## Question 3: 

 1. Implement the following functions in q.cc.
 2. Write some unit tests for them in student_test.cc

Write a function that returns the number of spaces in the given input string.

## Question 4: 

 1. Implement the following functions in q.cc.
 2. Write some unit tests for them in student_test.cc
    
Write a function to flatten a 3D􏰐vector into a 1D vector.

## Question 5: 

 1. Implement the following functions in q.cc.
 2. Write some unit tests for them in student_test.cc

Given a non-negative integer n, calculate the number of distinct ways a person can climb to the top of a staircase. Your function should accept positive numbers less than 45 and return the number of ways. We define the rules of climbing the stairs as follows:

You are climbing a staircase. Each time you can either climb 1 or 2 or 3 steps. It takes n steps to reach the top. Your function takes n as input.
If there are 0 stairs, return 0. For negative input, please return -1.

## Question 6: 
 1. Implement the following functions in q.cc.
 2. Write some unit tests for them in student_test.cc
    
Given two float values a and b, create a function in C++ that returns their sum, difference, product, and ratio (i.e., the result of dividing a by b). Use C++ references to return multiple values. The functions should return a value of type ErrorCode as a sign of success or failure

## Question 7: 
 1. Implement the following functions in q.cc.
 2. Write some unit tests for them in student_test.cc

Given two strings s and goal, create a function that returns true if and only if s can be transformed into goal after some number of left shifts on s. A shift on s consists of moving the leftmost character of s to the rightmost position. For example, if s is "abcde", then it will be "bcdea" after one shift.
